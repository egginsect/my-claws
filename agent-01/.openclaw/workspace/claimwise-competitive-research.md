# ClaimWise.ai Competitive Market Research
**Date:** February 4, 2026

## Executive Summary
ClaimWise occupies a unique but uncrowded position: a **horizontal claims discovery and management platform** for consumers. Most competitors specialize in one vertical (credit card rewards, flight compensation, or home insurance) rather than offering unified benefits discovery + claims tracking + AI chat assistance.

## 3. Positioning & Messaging Analysis

### How Competitors Position Themselves

| Company | Tagline/Hook | Tone |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **MaxRewards** | "Master Your Cards, Maximize Your Rewards" | Expert, optimization-focused |
| **AirHelp** | "Delayed flight? Get up to $650!" | Action-oriented, money-focused |
| **Lemonade** | "Forget everything you know about insurance" | Disruptive, anti-establishment |
| **Flightright** | "Stressing over a flight cancellation?" | Empathetic, problem-solving |
| **Trustworthy** | "Secure Everything That Matters" | Security, family-first |

### ClaimWise's Current Positioning
> "Discover and manage every claim with confidence"

**Analysis:** This is good but **generic**. It doesn't create urgency or quantify the opportunity.

## 5. Gaps & Opportunities

### 🔥 High-Impact Opportunities

1. **"Hidden Money Found" Quantification**
   - Show users: "You have $847 in unclaimed benefits"
   - AirHelp does this brilliantly ("Get up to $650!")

2. **Passive Income Detection (Email/Calendar Scanning)**
   - Auto-detect: flight delays, hotel cancellations, price drops
   - Users don't have to remember to check

3. **Native Mobile App**
   - Every major competitor has one
   - Push notifications for deadlines & new opportunities

4. **"No Win, No Fee" Claim Filing**
   - For complex claims (flights, warranty), handle filing for a cut
   - Removes friction, creates recurring revenue

5. **Expanded Benefits Database**
   - Partner with credit card issuers for real-time benefits data
   - Cover obscure benefits (cell phone protection, return protection)

### 🎯 Positioning Recommendations

**Current:** "Discover and manage every claim with confidence"

**Suggested alternatives:**
- "Stop leaving money on the table. Find your hidden benefits."
- "Your cards and policies are worth more than you think."
- "We found $847 hiding in your wallet. What about yours?"
- "The money-finding app for your insurance and credit cards"

### 💡 Feature Priorities

| Priority | Feature | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **P0** | Mobile app | Table stakes for consumer fintech |
| **P0** | Quantified savings dashboard | Drives engagement + virality |
| **P1** | Email scanning for auto-detection | Passive value discovery |
| **P1** | Success-fee claim filing service | Revenue + differentiation |
| **P2** | GPS-based "best card now" | Matches MaxRewards feature |
| **P2** | Integration with AirHelp/Flightright for flights | Partner vs. build |

---

## 6. Competitive Threats

1. **MaxRewards adding insurance** — They have 800K+ users and could expand
2. **Lemonade adding benefits discovery** — They have claims infrastructure
3. **Banks launching native benefits dashboards** — Chase, Amex already show some
4. **AI assistants (ChatGPT, etc.)** — Users might just ask AI about their policies

### Defensive Moats to Build
- Deep integrations with card issuers (API access)
- Proprietary benefits database with coverage details
- User-generated claim success data ("This worked for 94% of users")
- Community/social proof around successful claims

---

## 7. Key Takeaways

1. **ClaimWise's unique angle:** No one else combines cards + insurance + claims management in one place. Lean into this.

2. **Biggest gap:** No mobile app and no dollar-quantified value proposition.

3. **Revenue model:** Hybrid freemium + success fees is likely optimal.

4. **Messaging shift:** Move from "manage claims" → "find hidden money."

5. **Top 3 features to prioritize:**
   - Mobile app
   - "You have $X waiting" dashboard
   - One-click claim filing (with success fee option)
